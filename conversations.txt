I think NAME needs to get a life.
The Earth is swallowing me alive.
I wish I was smarter.
I'm really hungry right now.
You're really silly.
My shoe has a hole in it.
The weather is quite nice today.
Did you know NAME broke their arm last weekend?
A gorilla was seen in the city today stomping on flowers!
